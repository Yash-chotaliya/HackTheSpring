Overview:
This project aims to develop a payroll management system using Flutter and Firebase. The system allows administrators to manage employee data, track salary information, petrol expenses, and advances given to employees. Employees can register using a unique ID provided by the administrator and access their salary, advances, and expenses through a dashboard.

   - Track Salary Information: Admin can view and manage salary information for each employee, including monthly wages, bonuses, and deductions.
   - Manage Petrol Expenses: Admin can track petrol expenses incurred by employees for official purposes.
   - Manage Advances: Admin can provide advances to employees and track the advances given to each employee.

2. **Employee Registration:**
   - Employee Registration: Employees can register using a unique registration ID provided by the admin along with a password.
   - Access Dashboard: Once registered, employees can access a dashboard to view their salary, advances, and expenses.

3. **Dashboard:**
   - Visualize Data: Both admin and employees can visualize salary, advances, and expenses through graphs and charts for better understanding and analysis.
   - View Salary: Employees can view their monthly salary details including earnings and deductions.
   - View Advances: Employees can see the advances they have received and their repayment schedule.
   - View Expenses: Admin and employees can view petrol expenses and other expenses incurred by the company.
